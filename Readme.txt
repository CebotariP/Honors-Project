Hello! 

Done via the Innovaion Incubator through the Computer Science Department at Whitworth, I was able to work with Lutheran Community Services NW and their health record system. They needed help validating user input on date, physician, and treatment plan validation and verification in their health record systems.

This is a website created to showcase the honors project and the work done with a real client, set up by the CS Dept. Innovation Incubator.

I worked as a private contractor with this non-profit to make an MVP to validate data for their health record systems that utilize for their counseling services with immigrants and refugees.

I utilized a Bootstrap template to showcase my work, and it includes embedded peices of the MVP that I was able to share with this non-profit. This project was handed over to a new group of students after I graduated. I worked on documentation throughout this process, making the transition easier.
